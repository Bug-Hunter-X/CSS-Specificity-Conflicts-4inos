To solve this issue, ensure that your CSS selectors are specific enough to override conflicting styles.  In this case, we'll add an ID to the div to make it more specific.

```css
/* external.css */
div { color: blue; }

/* internal.css */
<style>
div { color: green; }
</style>

<div id="myDiv" style="color: red;">This is a div.</div>

/* solution.css */
#myDiv { color: yellow; } 
```

By adding the ID selector `#myDiv`, we make the rule in `solution.css` the most specific, ensuring that the text color is yellow.
