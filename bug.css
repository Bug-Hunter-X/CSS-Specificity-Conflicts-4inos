The CSS specificity rules can lead to unexpected behavior if not carefully managed.  For example, consider a situation where you have an inline style, an internal style sheet rule, and an external style sheet rule all targeting the same element with the same property but different values.

```css
/* external.css */
div { color: blue; }

/* internal.css */
<style>
div { color: green; }
</style>

<div style="color: red;">This is a div.</div>
